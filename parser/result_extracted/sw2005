s1_1 - s1_2
Okay .
s2_1 - s2_44
Uh SILENCE first SILENCE um SILENCE I need TRACE to know SILENCE uh SILENCE how do you feel TRACE <e> about SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE about <r> TRACE sending SILENCE uh SILENCE an elderly SILENCE uh SILENCE family member to a nursing home ?
s3_1 - s3_71
Well SILENCE of course SILENCE <e> it 's SILENCE <ip> you know SILENCE it 's <r> one of the last few things in the world TRACE you 'd ever want TRACE to do TRACE SILENCE you know . Unless it 's just SILENCE you know SILENCE really SILENCE you know SILENCE and SILENCE uh SILENCE <e> for their SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE you know SILENCE for their <r> own good .
s4_1 - s4_2
Yes .
s5_1 - s5_2
Yeah .
s6_1 - s6_21
I 'd be very very careful <e> and SILENCE <ip> <r> uh SILENCE you know SILENCE TRACE checking them out .
s7_1 - s7_4
Uh SILENCE our SILENCE
s8_1 - s8_13
TRACE had TRACE t- SILENCE place my mother in a nursing home .
s9_1 - s9_22
She had a rather massive stroke <e> about SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE about <r> uh SILENCE eight months ago I guess .
s10_1 - s10_2
Uh-huh .
s11_1 - s11_40
And SILENCE uh SILENCE <e> we were SILENCE <ip> I was <r> fortunate in that I was personally acquainted with the SILENCE uh SILENCE people who SILENCE uh SILENCE TRACE ran the nursing home in our little hometown .
s12_1 - s12_2
Yeah .
s13_1 - s13_30
So SILENCE I was very comfortable SILENCE you know SILENCE in TRACE doing it when it got to the point that we had TRACE to do it TRACE TRACE .
s14_1 - s14_4
But there 's SILENCE
s15_1 - s15_43
well SILENCE I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who TRACE had fell and <e> needed TRACE to be SILENCE <ip> <r> you know SILENCE could not take care of herself anymore SILENCE was confined TRACE to a nursing home for a while
s16_1 - s16_9
that was really not a very good experience .
s17_1 - s17_13
Uh SILENCE it had TRACE to be done TRACE in a hurry .
s18_1 - s18_23
I mean SILENCE we did n't have SILENCE you know SILENCE like six months TRACE to check all of these places out .
s19_1 - s19_17
And it was really <e> not SILENCE <ip> not <r> very good SILENCE uh SILENCE deal .
s20_1 - s20_2
Yeah .
s21_1 - s21_15
We were not really happy with SILENCE nursing home that we finally had TRACE .
s22_1 - s22_2
Yeah .
s23_1 - s23_11
Fortunately SILENCE she only had TRACE to stay a few weeks
s24_1 - s24_17
and she was able TRACE <e> to SILENCE <ip> to <r> return to her apartment again .
s25_1 - s25_33
But it 's really a <e> big SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE big SILENCE <r> uh SILENCE decision <e> as to SILENCE <ip> you know SILENCE when TRACE to <r> do it TRACE .
s26_1 - s26_2
Yeah .
s27_1 - s27_33
You know SILENCE is there something else TRACE we could have done TRACE SILENCE you know SILENCE in TRACE checking out all the places that SILENCE uh SILENCE TRACE might be available .
s28_1 - s28_25
Of course SILENCE you know SILENCE there 's not one on every corner SILENCE especially SILENCE you know SILENCE smaller areas SILENCE smaller towns .
s29_1 - s29_2
Yeah .
s30_1 - s30_2
Uh-huh .
s31_1 - s31_2
Uh-huh .
s32_1 - s32_2
Yeah .
s33_1 - s33_29
Probably the hardest thing <e> in SILENCE <ip> in <r> my family SILENCE uh SILENCE my grandmother SILENCE she had TRACE to be put TRACE in a nursing home
s34_1 - s34_26
and SILENCE um SILENCE she had used the walker <e> for SILENCE <ip> for <r> quite some time SILENCE probably about six to nine months .
s35_1 - s35_8
And SILENCE um SILENCE she had a fall
s36_1 - s36_14
and SILENCE uh SILENCE finally SILENCE uh SILENCE she had Parkinson 's disease SILENCE
s37_1 - s37_2
Oh .
s38_1 - s38_15
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house .
s39_1 - s39_2
Right .
s40_1 - s40_6
Then she lived in an apartment
s41_1 - s41_10
and SILENCE uh SILENCE that was even harder actually .
s42_1 - s42_2
Uh-huh .
s43_1 - s43_2
Uh-huh .
s44_1 - s44_23
Because <e> it was SILENCE <ip> you know SILENCE it was <r> just a <e> change of SILENCE <ip> change of <r> location
s45_1 - s45_16
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling .
s46_1 - s46_2
Yes .
s47_1 - s47_23
I mean SILENCE <e> she tr- SILENCE she had SILENCE <ip> she had <r> children all across the United States
s48_1 - s48_1
Uh-huh
s49_1 - s49_19
and SILENCE you know SILENCE she spent nine months out of the year TRACE just visiting her children .
s50_1 - s50_2
Right .
s51_1 - s51_2
Uh-huh .
s52_1 - s52_11
And SILENCE um SILENCE that was pretty heart-rending for her .
s53_1 - s53_4
I can imagine .
s54_1 - s54_33
I think TRACE when she finally came to the realization that SILENCE you know SILENCE no SILENCE <e> I can not SILENCE <ip> I can not <r> take care of myself TRACE .
s55_1 - s55_2
Uh-huh .
s56_1 - s56_4
That 's tough .
s57_1 - s57_4
That 's tough .
s58_1 - s58_2
Yeah .
s59_1 - s59_55
I mean SILENCE for somebody who TRACE <e> is SILENCE <ip> <r> you know SILENCE for most of their life <e> has SILENCE <ip> has SILENCE <r> uh SILENCE not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm SILENCE ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines .
s60_1 - s60_2
Uh-huh .
s61_1 - s61_2
Uh-huh .
s62_1 - s62_22
And SILENCE you know SILENCE TRACE facing that situation SILENCE <e> it 's SILENCE <ip> it 's <r> quite a dilemma .
s63_1 - s63_2
Yes .
s64_1 - s64_3
I think SILENCE
s65_1 - s65_7
my mother SILENCE TRACE excuse me .
s66_1 - s66_4
TRACE Go ahead .
s67_1 - s67_2
Yeah .
s68_1 - s68_13
Well SILENCE <e> my SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE my SILENCE <r> uh SILENCE
s69_1 - s69_32
probably one of the biggest decisions I think that TRACE was very strengthening for our family was rather than TRACE have one child make that decision than just TRACE delegate it .
s70_1 - s70_2
Uh-huh .
s71_1 - s71_17
I think that <e> they SILENCE <ip> they <r> had a great deal of SILENCE um SILENCE
s72_1 - s72_7
all the brothers and sisters got together
s73_1 - s73_7
and they actually had a conference .
s74_1 - s74_4
That 's great .
s75_1 - s75_33
And SILENCE I mean SILENCE <e> it was just SILENCE <ip> it was probably <r> one of the most strengthening things for our family SILENCE TRACE getting down together and doing that .
s76_1 - s76_4
That 's right .
s77_2 - s77_39
<e> And SILENCE <ip> and <r> just the children were involved in the decision TRACE SILENCE because it involved just them . <e> And SILENCE <ip> <r> you know SILENCE TRACE making that decision and then finding a place
s78_1 - s78_2
Right .
s79_1 - s79_2
Yeah .
s80_1 - s80_10
and everybody had duties TRACE TRACE to perform TRACE .
s81_1 - s81_2
Uh-huh .
s82_1 - s82_42
You know SILENCE whether it was just SILENCE you know SILENCE TRACE giving money or whether it was actually TRACE taking part in a lot SILENCE of the decision making SILENCE you know SILENCE like TRACE finding a proper nursing home .
s83_1 - s83_2
Uh-huh .
s84_1 - s84_2
Yep .
s85_1 - s85_6
You were very SILENCE fortunate .
s86_1 - s86_3
And they SILENCE
s87_1 - s87_3
I know .
s88_2 - s88_29
<e> They SILENCE <ip> and SILENCE well SILENCE they had SILENCE well SILENCE they had SILENCE they had <r> seen it coming .
s89_1 - s89_2
Uh-huh .
s90_2 - s90_6
<e> So SILENCE <ip> so SILENCE <r>
s91_1 - s91_5
I mean SILENCE it SILENCE
s92_1 - s92_53
I mean SILENCE <e> I SILENCE I SILENCE I SILENCE I har- SILENCE I SILENCE <ip> I <r> truly wish that if something like that were TRACE to happen that my children would do something like SILENCE that for me .
s93_1 - s93_2
Uh-huh .
s94_1 - s94_2
Uh-huh .
s95_1 - s95_2
Absolutely .
s96_1 - s96_34
Unfortunately SILENCE a lot of times <e> it SILENCE <ip> responsibilities <r> like that seem TRACE to fall to SILENCE you know SILENCE maybe one child in the whole family SILENCE you know .
s97_1 - s97_2
Yeah .
s98_1 - s98_2
Yeah .
s99_1 - s99_8
Well SILENCE <e> we SILENCE <ip> we SILENCE <r>
s100_1 - s100_18
And SILENCE uh SILENCE it 's usually not a very <e> smooth SILENCE <ip> smooth <r> thing .
s101_1 - s101_2
Yeah .
s102_2 - s102_18
<e> We were SILENCE <ip> I was <r> lucky TRACE too that I only have one brother .
s103_1 - s103_2
Uh-huh .
s104_1 - s104_28
And SILENCE uh SILENCE fortunately SILENCE we agreed SILENCE you know SILENCE on exactly SILENCE you know SILENCE what we thought TRACE TRACE should be done TRACE .
s105_1 - s105_11
My mother also was <e> very <ip> very <r> independent .
s106_1 - s106_25
She <e> had her own SILENCE <ip> still had her own <r> little house and still driving her own car SILENCE at age eighty-three .
s107_1 - s107_2
Yeah .
s108_1 - s108_40
We were lucky <e> in SILENCE that <ip> in one <r> respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't <e> really SILENCE <ip> you know SILENCE really <r> much aware of what TRACE was going on .
s109_1 - s109_2
Uh-huh .
s110_1 - s110_17
That nursing home life would not have been SILENCE you know SILENCE anything of her choosing SILENCE
s111_1 - s111_19
of course SILENCE <e> she would SILENCE <ip> she would <r> not have been happy there at all .
s112_1 - s112_2
Um .
s113_1 - s113_15
But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us .
s114_1 - s114_2
Yeah .
s115_1 - s115_2
Yeah .
s116_1 - s116_38
Well SILENCE <e> with my SILENCE <ip> with my <r> grandmother I think <e> it was SILENCE <ip> it was <r> such <e> that SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE that <r> she did not have the problem with SILENCE
s117_1 - s117_5
she was very well aware
s118_1 - s118_7
and her daughter came and visited her
s119_1 - s119_2
Uh-huh .
s120_1 - s120_9
at least her daughter SILENCE came and visited her
s121_1 - s121_13
and also her several grandchildren SILENCE came and visited her every day .
s122_1 - s122_2
Uh-huh .
s123_1 - s123_2
Uh-huh .
s124_1 - s124_4
That 's great .
s125_1 - s125_17
And I think that when she passed away TRACE it was probably one of the greatest SILENCE
s126_1 - s126_19
um SILENCE <e> I SILENCE I SILENCE <ip> I <r> think TRACE it would be SILENCE
s127_1 - s127_9
it was more of a relief for her .
s128_1 - s128_2
Uh-huh .
s129_1 - s129_2
Sure .
s130_1 - s130_4
And SILENCE um SILENCE
s131_1 - s131_16
I mean SILENCE but <e> she was truly SILENCE <ip> she was truly <r> aware .
s132_1 - s132_69
I mean SILENCE <e> I SILENCE I SILENCE I di- SILENCE <ip> I <r> do n't know <e> how I would SILENCE <ip> how I would <r> deal TRACE if one of my parents came <e> with SILENCE <ip> with <r> Alzheimer 's . or something like SILENCE that <e> which TRACE is SILENCE <ip> which TRACE is <r> far more devastating .
s133_1 - s133_2
Uh-huh .
s134_1 - s134_5
That would be tough .
s135_1 - s135_2
Yes .
s136_1 - s136_2
Absolutely .
s137_1 - s137_50
And SILENCE um SILENCE <e> I SILENCE I SILENCE <ip> I <r> think that what one thing that they were concerned TRACE probably was the fact TRACE it was n't necessarily SILENCE you know SILENCE like the quantity of care but the quality of SILENCE care .
s138_1 - s138_2
Uh-huh .
s139_1 - s139_2
Yes .
s140_1 - s140_31
That the people that TRACE worked there <e> were very <ip> were very <r> interested that SILENCE TRACE to make it as close TRACE a home environment SILENCE as possible .
s141_1 - s141_2
Right .
s142_1 - s142_2
Uh-huh .
s143_1 - s143_2
Uh-huh .
s144_1 - s144_2
Yes .
s145_1 - s145_3
It would SILENCE
s146_3 - s146_44
<e> I think SILENCE I think SILENCE <ip> I think SILENCE <r> TRACE you know for myself <e> I SILENCE <ip> I <r> see that as probably <e> the SILENCE <ip> the SILENCE <r> what everything would hinge upon TRACE .
s147_1 - s147_2
Oh SILENCE
s148_1 - s148_3
Is it SILENCE
s149_1 - s149_10
how close is it TRACE to a home environment .
s150_1 - s150_2
Yes .
s151_1 - s151_4
That 's right .
s152_2 - s152_14
<e> That 's the SILENCE <ip> that 's probably the <r> major question .
s153_1 - s153_45
I think that great strides TRACE are being made TRACE nowadays <e> in SILENCE <ip> in <r> TRACE caring for the elderly SILENCE you know SILENCE <e> in several SILENCE in a SILENCE <ip> in a <r> whole lot of areas .
s154_1 - s154_2
Yeah .
s155_1 - s155_2
Yeah .
s156_1 - s156_11
Just people are SILENCE of course SILENCE populations getting older .
s157_1 - s157_2
Yeah .
s158_1 - s158_59
You know <e> it 's SILENCE <ip> it TRACE 's <r> interesting <e> that SILENCE <ip> that a lot SILENCE <r> the population of the United States is changing because SILENCE you know SILENCE uh SILENCE now that so many more minorities SILENCE where they have had extended families for such a long time TRACE .
s159_1 - s159_2
Uh-huh .
s160_1 - s160_17
Um SILENCE matter of fact in the United States we used TRACE to have extended families .
s161_1 - s161_2
Uh-huh SILENCE
s162_1 - s162_4
It was n't SILENCE
s163_1 - s163_2
true .
s164_1 - s164_75
But SILENCE I guess TRACE as we become more industrialized and more SILENCE you know SILENCE less in a rural situation <e> we SILENCE we do n't SILENCE we SILENCE we SILENCE <ip> we <r> choose TRACE not to deal with the SILENCE extended family because we feel TRACE it 's kind of cumbersome SILENCE when in reality it makes things much much easier TRACE .
s165_1 - s165_4
Yes SILENCE um .
s166_1 - s166_2
Uh-huh .
s167_1 - s167_2
Uh-huh .
s168_1 - s168_4
That 's right .
s169_1 - s169_2
Sure .
s170_1 - s170_2
Absolutely .
s171_1 - s171_14
And SILENCE <e> people SILENCE <ip> things <r> are scattered so much nowadays .
s172_1 - s172_4
Uh . Yeah .
s173_1 - s173_2
Yeah .
s174_3 - s174_42
<e> I SILENCE I SILENCE <ip> I <r> think that <e> perhaps SILENCE <ip> perhaps <r> the extended family SILENCE you know SILENCE that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care .
s175_1 - s175_2
Yes .
s176_1 - s176_55
You know I mean SILENCE of course <e> there SILENCE <ip> there <r> comes other issues SILENCE you know SILENCE whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like <e> are going TRACE to be a good SILENCE <ip> they 're going TRACE to be a good <r> caretaker for our children .
s177_1 - s177_2
Yes SILENCE
s178_1 - s178_2
But SILENCE
s179_1 - s179_6
just because they 're grandparents .
s180_1 - s180_8
I mean they raised us after all .
s181_1 - s181_2
Yeah .
s182_1 - s182_16
Just because they 're grandparents that does n't automatically make them a good child carer .
s183_1 - s183_2
Yeah .
s184_1 - s184_72
But SILENCE uh SILENCE <e> I SILENCE I SILENCE <ip> I <r> think that SILENCE you know SILENCE <e> we always SILENCE <ip> <r> uh SILENCE I mean SILENCE <e> I 've SILENCE <ip> I 've <r> had a lot of good experiences <e> with SILENCE <ip> uh SILENCE with many many <r> people especially where they 've had SILENCE uh SILENCE extended family TRACE .
s185_2 - s185_58
<e> And I SILENCE <ip> and I SILENCE I <r> kind of see <e> that SILENCE <ip> that SILENCE <r> you know SILENCE perhaps SILENCE you know SILENCE we may need TRACE to like get close to the family environment <e> and <ip> and <r> get down to the values of SILENCE you know SILENCE
s186_1 - s186_2
Uh-huh .
s187_1 - s187_8
I mean SILENCE uh SILENCE it 's SILENCE
s188_1 - s188_33
money seems TRACE to be too big of an issue . <e> With SILENCE with SILENCE with SILENCE <ip> with <r> what TRACE 's going on today
s189_1 - s189_4
Oh SILENCE yeah .
s190_1 - s190_2
sure .
s191_1 - s191_5
realistically it is TRACE .
s192_1 - s192_56
and <e> I SILENCE <ip> I think SILENCE I think <r> that <e> we may not SILENCE <ip> that may be SILENCE <r> you know SILENCE perhaps if we put money on the back burner <e> that may SILENCE <ip> that may <r> choose TRACE to alleviate a lot of the problem .
s193_1 - s193_2
Uh-huh .
s194_1 - s194_6
That would SILENCE certainly help .
s195_1 - s195_22
I mean SILENCE I mean <e> we may not SILENCE <ip> we may not <r> have as high a standard of living
s196_1 - s196_2
Uh-huh .
s197_2 - s197_17
<e> but the qua- SILENCE <ip> but actually TRACE have a truer standard <r> of living .
s198_1 - s198_2
Right .
s199_1 - s199_17
That 's just a matter of TRACE defining priorities SILENCE I guess or some priorities anyway .
s200_1 - s200_2
Yeah .
s201_1 - s201_2
Yeah .
s202_1 - s202_2
Yeah .
s203_1 - s203_7
I think TRACE you 're right .
s204_1 - s204_2
Okay .
s205_1 - s205_9
Well SILENCE I guess TRACE that was it .
s206_1 - s206_2
Okay .
s207_1 - s207_9
It TRACE was good TRACE talking to you .
s208_1 - s208_2
Okay .
s209_1 - s209_2
Yeah .
s210_1 - s210_3
All right .
s211_1 - s211_4
TRACE Take care .
s212_1 - s212_2
Hey .
s213_1 - s213_2
Bye-bye .
